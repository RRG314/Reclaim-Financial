Help Us Build Banking That Gives Back

We're creating the first nonprofit payment platform that turns everyday transactions into charitable impact.

The Problem

Every time you send money on Venmo, use Cash App, or pay with PayPal, those companies make a profit. Billions of dollars flow through payment platforms each year, generating massive profits for shareholders and executives.

What if those profits could help communities instead?

Our Solution: Reclaim Financial

Reclaim Financial is a nonprofit payment platform that works exactly like Venmo, Cash App, or PayPal, with one crucial difference:

Instead of enriching shareholders, we automatically convert profits into charitable donations.

- Same free P2P transfers you're used to
- Same convenience and security as major platforms
- Same optional instant transfer fees (1.75%)
- But 35% of all revenue goes directly to verified charities

You won't pay extra. You won't change how you use money. Just by banking with Reclaim instead of a for-profit company, you'll automatically generate $55 to $93 in charitable giving every year.

How It Works

REVENUE SOURCES (Just Like Other Platforms):

1. Standard transfers: FREE (builds our user base)
2. Instant transfers: 1.75% optional fee (if you want money immediately)
3. Credit card payments: 3% fee (when users choose credit cards)
4. Debit card interchange: around 0.6% (merchants pay this, not you)
5. Business accounts: 2.9% + $0.30 (competitive with PayPal)

EVERY DOLLAR OF REVENUE SPLITS:

65% goes to Operations (fair salaries, technology, compliance, security)
35% goes to Charitable Giving (verified 501(c)(3) organizations)

OUR COMMITMENT:

Maximum salary: $81,250 (no executive excess. No one gets rich)
Complete transparency (quarterly public reports)
Community votes on charitable recipients
Open financial records (you see where every dollar goes)

Why This Will Succeed

WE'RE NOT ASKING USERS TO PAY MORE
Our pricing matches Venmo and Cash App exactly. People switch because they want their financial activity to create social good, not because we're cheaper or more expensive.

WE'RE USING A PROVEN BUSINESS MODEL
This is exactly how Cash App, Venmo, and PayPal make billions. We're just redirecting those profits to communities instead of investors.

PEOPLE WANT THIS
More and more consumers are seeking ways to align their spending with their values. We're giving them a way to do it effortlessly, every day.

WE SEEK THE EXPERTISE
Our founding team will bring experience in fintech, nonprofit management, technology development, and community organizing.


Every donation brings us closer to proving that finance can serve people, not profit.

The Big Picture

This isn't just about building another app. It's about proving a concept:

Banking doesn't have to extract wealth. It can create community wealth.

When we succeed with Reclaim Financial, we'll demonstrate that fair wages and transparency are sustainable, that consumers will choose ethical alternatives, that everyday transactions can fund social good, and that the nonprofit model works for fintech.

We'll inspire other industries to follow. We'll show that another way is possible.

Transparency Promise

Every quarter, we'll publish detailed reports showing:

Total users and transaction volume
Revenue by source
Operating costs (with full breakdown)
Charitable distributions (every organization, every dollar)
Salary information (every staff member)
Progress toward goals

You'll know exactly where your money goes and what impact it creates.

Join the Movement

For generations, banking has been about extraction, taking money from everyday people and concentrating it among the wealthy.

Reclaim Financial flips that model.

Every transaction becomes an act of community support. Every card swipe generates charitable impact. Every user becomes a philanthropist without paying extra or changing their behavior.

Help us prove that fairness can be engineered into finance.

Your contribution isn't just launching a payment platform. It's funding a proof of concept for ethical capitalism. You're investing in the idea that businesses can serve communities first and still be sustainable.
